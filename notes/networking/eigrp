- enhanced interior gateway routing protocol (EIGRP), Cisco-proprietary

- classes routing protocol (sends subnet mask of its interfaces in routing updates)

- uses a complex metric based on bandwidth and delay

- hybrid routing protocol as it has characteristics of both distance-vector and link-state protocols

- support for VLSM (variable length subnet mask) and discontigous networks

- use reliable transport protocol (RTP) for delivery and reception of EIGRP packets

- use best path selection Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL), gaurantees loop-free paths and
  backup paths 

- supports multiple protocols (IPV4, IPV6, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks)

- load balancing (supports unequal metric load balancing which allows admins to better distribute
  traffic flow)

- use metrics composed of bandwidth, delay, reliability and load (default is just bandwidth and
  delay)

- use five types of packets to communicate

	* hello: used to identify neighbors (periodic multicasts)
 	* update: advertise routes (multicasts when something changed)
	* ack: acknowledge receipt of update (unicast, ack is hello packet with no data)
	* query: used to find alternate paths when all paths to destination have failed
	* reply: response to query packets to instruct originator not to recompute the route
		 because feasible successors exist (unicast)

- every query and reply message sent using RTP so every message is acknowledged using ACK message

Discovery process:

  1) router will attempt to establish a neighboring relationship by sending HELLO packet
     (multicast address 224.0.0.10 is multicast address of EIGRP)

  2) neighboring router will receive HELLO packet and respond with another HELLO packet

  3) neighbor will also send its routing table by UPDATE packets (complete table first time,
     updates thereafter)

  4) router will ACK information

  5) router will also send UPDATE containing its full routing table 

  6) neighbor ACK information

- both routers have now learned paths of the neighbor and the network is converged

- HELLO message will continue to be sent to indicate router is still alive to its neighbors

- when something changes in network, routers will send only partial updates to routers that 
  need that info

- HELLO packets are sent as periodic multicast and are not ACK directly

- first HELLO are used to build a list of neighbors; thereafter, HELLO indicates the neighbor is
  still alive

- to become a neighbor the following conditions must be met

  1) router must hear HELLO packet from a neighbor

  2) EIGRP AS must be the same

  3) K-values must be the same

- builds and maintains three tables

  1) neighor table (directly connected routers)

  2) topology table (all routes learned from each neighbor)

  3) routing table (all best routers from topology table and other routing processes)

- set the autonomous system (AS) number and enable on all interfaces belowing to a network

syntax: 

	router eigrp <AS number>
	network NETWORK

example:

	router eigrp 1
	network 192.168.1.0	# EIGRP 1 process on interfaces belonging to 192.168.1.0/24

advertised distance (AD): cost from neighbor to destination

feasibe distance (FD): sum of AD plus cost between local router and next hop router

successor: primary route used to reach a destination (kept in routing table, best route to dest)

feasible successor: backup route

- to be a feasible successor the route must have an AD lass than FD of current successor route (this
  guarantees a loop-free path to destination)

- if route via successor becomes invalid or if a neighbor changes the metric, DUAL checks for
  feasible successors to destination route, if found use it, avoiding need to recompute the route

- if no suitable feasible successor exists, re-computation must occur to determine the new successor

syntax:

	# view the neighbor table
	show ip eigrp neighbors

- hold (sec): column is amount of time left before neighbor is considered in "down" status

- uptime: amount of time since adjency was established

- SRRT: smooth round trip timer, average time in ms between transmission of a packet and receipt
        of ACK

- RTO: retransmission timeout, if multicast ahs failed, use unicast and wait this amount of time for
       ACK

- Queue count: number of queued packets (usually 0)

- sequence Number: seq number of last update packet received (each update message is given a seq
                   number and received ACK should have same number)

- show topology table 

syntax:

	# view the topology table
	show ip eigrp topology

example:

	show ip eigrp topology

	IP-EIGRP Topology Table for AS 100

	Codes: P - Passive, A - Active, U - Update, Q - Query, R - Reply, r - Reply status

	P 192.168.2.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 28160
		via Connected, FastEthernet0/1
	P 192.168.5.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 30720
		via 192.168.1.2 (30720/28160), FastEthernet0/0
		via 192.168.2.2 (30720/28160), FastEthernet0/1

- Passive state indicates that route is in quiescent mode, implying route is known to be good and
  that no activities are taking place with respect to the route

- each route shows number of successor it has

- numbers inside brackets are metric from router to destination and AD of this route (advertised
  by the neighbor, metric from neighbor to router)

syntax:

	# show all neighbors whether they are feasible successors or not
	show ip eigrp topology all-links

keywords: metric,K,values,calculate,view
link: http://njuniors.blogspot.com/2013/01/eigrp-tutorials.html

- formula to calculate the metric is:

	metric = [K1*bandwidth + (K2*bandwidth)/(256-load) + K3*delay] * [K5/(reliability+K4)]

- by default K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3 = 1, K4 = 0 and K5 = 0 so

	metric = bandwidth + delay

syntax:

	# view K values
	show ip protocols 

- bandwidth is defined as the slowest bandwidth in the route to the destination and delay is sum
  of delays of each link, therefore

	metric = [ 10,000,000 / slowest bandwidth in kbps + sum of delay (usec) / 10 ] * 256

- find bandwidth of each interface using show interfaces (BW will be shown in Kbit)

- delay of outgoing interfaces can also be determined using show interfaces (DLY will be shown in
  usec), add all the values of the interfaces to the route

- delay is sum of delays of each link

	Gateway of last resort is not set

 	     		   [90/30720] via 192.168.2.2, 00:00:08, FastEthernet0/1

- routing table has two parameters [90/30720]

- first is administrative distance of EIGRP (default of 90)

- administrative distance is the measure used by Cisco routers to select best path when there are
  two or more different routes to same destination from two different routing protocols

- directly connect - AD: 0, static - AD: 1, EIGRP - AD: 90, EIGRP summary route - AD: 5,
  OSPF - AD: 110, RIP - AD: 120

discontiguous networks: networks that have subnets of a major network separated by a different
			major network

syntax:

	router eigrp 1
	no auto-summary

- when router advertise its networks it will do so with their subnet mask

- if auto-summary is on and both routers summarize the same network, a collision will happen and 
  the router will not learn the advertised route
