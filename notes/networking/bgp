- when two or more routes exist to particular prefix, default route to prefer is one with shortest
  AS Path length

- AS path prepending is probably easiest method one can use to influence inbound routing to your AS

- BGP (unlike EIGRP) doesn't take bandwidth into consideration

- AS Path prepending you artificially lengthen AS Path that you advertise to a neighbor (make it
  seem like route has more hops)

- use route-map (Cisco) applied to (certain) outbound BGP sessions

syntax:

	route-map PREPEND permit 10
		set as-path prepend AS# AS#
		router bgp AS
			neighbor NETWORK route-map PREPEND out

example:

	route-map PREPEND permit 10
		set as-path prepend 67 67
		router bgp 67
			neighbor 172.21.79.9 route-map PREPEND out
