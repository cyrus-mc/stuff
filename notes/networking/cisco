- provide security group-based access control using security group-based tags (SGTs)

- tag user traffic with role information

- identity information may be carried throughout network and used by devices deeper in
  network for policy control

- SGTs allow enterprises to build simple role-based access policies that are topology
  independent and provide operational flexibility compared to VLANs and dACLs

- SGA (Security Group Access) builds a trusted network infrastructure

- devices authenticate each other (Network Device Admission Control/NDAC)

- NDAC uses EAP-FAST to authenticate switches to Cisco ISE so they can obtain SGT and
  other identity information

- also secures network by providing encryption at Layer 2 via MACsec (802.1 AE)

- traffic is encrypted from switch to switch (packets encrypted on egress for 
  transmission then decrypted on ingress where they can be inspected within switch)

- requires a device to behave as an 802.1x supplication to gain access to Cisco
  TrustSec network

- after admission, device is able to act as an authenticator, in turn admitting other
  supplications devices 

- one device (Seed Device) needs to be configured with knowledge of at least one
  Cisco ISE

- subsequent devices are called Non-Seed Device, are authenticated by its peer devices
  already within the domain

- peers act as intermediaries for the domain authentication server

- each newly authenticated device is categorized by the authentication server and
  assigned a security group n umber based on its identity, role and security purpose

- as part of policy aquisition phase (authorization), a Cisco TrustSec capable device
  receives an SGT called a Device SGT

- Device SGT represent security group to which device belongs and is exchanged with
  neighbor device as a token of trusted devices

- Device SGT is configured on ISE prior to the seed device NDAC process

procedure:

Configure Device SGT and create a policy that tags devices as they get added to ISE:

	1) Policy -> Policy Elements -> Results -> Security Group Access -> Security
	   Groups

	2) Add and Submit when complete

	3) Policy -> Security Group Access -> Network Device Authorization

	4) Click Actions and insert a new row

	5) Create an NDAC Policy

Define AAA Client

	1) Administration -> Network Resources -> Network Devices

	2) Add

	3) Fill out radius settings

	4) Enable SGA and complete settings

Configure Private Server List

	1) Administration -> Network Resources -> SGA AAA Servers

	2) Ensure the SGA AAA server is present

Modify the Authority-ID Description (useful when troubleshooting PAC related problems)

	1) Administration -> Settings -> Protocols -> EAP-FAST -> EAP-FAST Settings

	2) Change "Authority Identity info Description to a unique identifier

Configure Switch

	1) Enter configuration mode and enable 802.1X and SGA features
