- connect console cable

- power cycle 

- watch boot progress and when prompted press Esc to interrupt 

- this will enter ROM monitor mode with prompt rommon #0>

- enter confreq comment to view current configuration register setting

	rommon #0> confreq

- default setting will be 0x01

- answer no when ask if you want to change it

- change configuration register to 0x41 (cause appliance to bypass saved config)

	rommon #1> confreq 0x41

- reboot appliance

	rommon #2> boot

- set enable password

	ciscoasa> enable

- erase startup config

	ciscoasa# write erase

- enter configuration mode

	ciscoasa# configure terminal

- reset configuration register to default of 0x01

	ciscoasa(config)# config-register 0x01

- save settings

	ciscoasa# write

- reboot appliance

	ciscoasa# reload

- local database can be used for CLI access authentication, privileged mode
  authentication, command authorization, network access auth and VPN auth and
  authorization

- can't use for network access authorization

- in multiple context mode you can configure usernames in system execution
  space to provide individual logins using login command

- syntax

	username NAME {nopassword | password PASS [mschap]} [privilege LEVEL]

- default privilege is 2, if aaa authorization command LOCAL not defined this
  allows management access to privilege EXEC mode

- admin keyword is default and allows full access to any services specified by the aaa
  authentication console LOCAL commands

- nas-prompt allows access to CLI when you configure aaa authentication {telnet|ssh|serial}
  console LOCAL command

- nas-prompt denies ASDM config access if you config the aaa authentication http console LOCAL

- ASDM monitoring access is allowed

- if you config enable auth with aaa authentication enable console LOCAL user cannot access
  privileged EXEC mode using enable

- remote-access keyword denies management access (user can't use any service specified by
  aaa authentication console LOCAL commands, excluding serial)

- authenticate users with AAA server or local database when using enable command

- alternatively users are automatically authenticated with local database when they enter
  login command

- if you do not authenticate enable ASA prompts for system enable password and you are no
  longer logged in as a particular user

- maintaining username is important when you perform command authorization where usernames
  are important to determine the commands a user can enter

- syntax:

	aaa authentication enable console {LOCAL | server_grp [LOCAL]}

- provide security group-based access control using security group-based tags (SGTs)

- tag user traffic with role information

- identity information may be carried throughout network and used by devices deeper in
  network for policy control

- SGTs allow enterprises to build simple role-based access policies that are topology
  independent and provide operational flexibility compared to VLANs and dACLs

- SGA (Security Group Access) builds a trusted network infrastructure

- devices authenticate each other (Network Device Admission Control/NDAC)

- NDAC uses EAP-FAST to authenticate switches to Cisco ISE so they can obtain SGT and
  other identity information

- also secures network by providing encryption at Layer 2 via MACsec (802.1 AE)

- traffic is encrypted from switch to switch (packets encrypted on egress for 
  transmission then decrypted on ingress where they can be inspected within switch)

- requires a device to behave as an 802.1x supplication to gain access to Cisco
  TrustSec network

- after admission, device is able to act as an authenticator, in turn admitting other
  supplications devices 

- one device (Seed Device) needs to be configured with knowledge of at least one
  Cisco ISE

- subsequent devices are called Non-Seed Device, are authenticated by its peer devices
  already within the domain

- peers act as intermediaries for the domain authentication server

- each newly authenticated device is categorized by the authentication server and
  assigned a security group n umber based on its identity, role and security purpose

- as part of policy aquisition phase (authorization), a Cisco TrustSec capable device
  receives an SGT called a Device SGT

- Device SGT represent security group to which device belongs and is exchanged with
  neighbor device as a token of trusted devices

- Device SGT is configured on ISE prior to the seed device NDAC process

procedure:

Configure Device SGT and create a policy that tags devices as they get added to ISE:

	1) Policy -> Policy Elements -> Results -> Security Group Access -> Security
	   Groups

	2) Add and Submit when complete

	3) Policy -> Security Group Access -> Network Device Authorization

	4) Click Actions and insert a new row

	5) Create an NDAC Policy

Define AAA Client

	1) Administration -> Network Resources -> Network Devices

	2) Add

	3) Fill out radius settings

	4) Enable SGA and complete settings

Configure Private Server List

	1) Administration -> Network Resources -> SGA AAA Servers

	2) Ensure the SGA AAA server is present

Modify the Authority-ID Description (useful when troubleshooting PAC related problems)

	1) Administration -> Settings -> Protocols -> EAP-FAST -> EAP-FAST Settings

	2) Change "Authority Identity info Description to a unique identifier

Configure Switch

	1) Enter configuration mode and enable 802.1X and SGA features
