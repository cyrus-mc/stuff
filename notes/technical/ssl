- relies on concept of public key cryptography (each party has a public and private key)
  (info encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the private and vice versa)

- the following handshake takes place to establish SSL connection

	* server sends public key to client

	* client validates certificate (not expired, CN valid, CA certificate)

	* client sends public key to server

	* server creates a unique hash and encrypts it using client public key and server
	  private key and sends this to client

	* client will decrypt hash (this process shows server sent hash and only client is
	  able to read it)

	* secure channel now established

- public, private keys require you to have the public key of the sender and the private key of
  recipient (client) to decrypt
