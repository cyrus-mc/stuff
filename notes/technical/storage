- transfer rates: 

	(throughput, bandwidth) are determined by sequential reads and writes, or
  	how fast data can be transferred from contiguous storage locations on disk

	amount of data that can be pushed through a common point in the data path in a given
	time

- measured in MB/s

- IOPS

	refer to maximum number of reads and writes to non-contiguous storage locations

	aggregate metric, a measure of the total number of storage transactions being processed
	through a system or a single storage port every second

- measured as an integer and dominated by seak time (time it takes for a disk to position its
  read/write heads over the correct location) 

- calculation of 'raw IOPS'

	IOPS = 1 / (Avg Seek Time + Avg Latency)

- alternatively use rule of thumb

	* 180 IOPS for 15k RPM drive
	* 120 IOPS for 10k RPM drive
	* 80 IOPS for 7500 RPM drive
	* 40 IOPS for 5400 RPM drive

- to get raw IOPS for storage array, simply multiply individual disk IOPS by number of spindles

keywords: latency

link: http://storageswiss.com/2013/12/10/what-is-latency-and-how-is-it-different-from-iops/

- transaction

	requests for data made by servers and the process of finding and accessing the blocks
	of data out of the storage systems to fulfill those requests

- latency

	measure of time required for a sub-system or a component in that sub-system to process
	a single storage transaction or data request

- refers to how long it takes for a single data request to be received and the right data found
  and accessed from storage media

example:

	- in a disk drive, read latency is time required for controller to find data blocks and
	  place the heads over those blocks (including time needed to spin the disk platters) to
	  begin transfer process

- primary factor in both IOPS and throughput calculations

- its impact on storage performance is fundamental, so reducing latency will universally improve
  performance
