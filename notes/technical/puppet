- enable puppet labs repository

	rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-el-6.noarch.rpm

- install necessary packages

	yum install puppet-server

- create puppet master's certificate with every possible DNS name

- make sure DNS resolves puppet master (or its load balancer)

- set dns_alt_names to comma-separated list of each hostname master should be allowed to use

[main]
	dns_alt_names = puppet,puppet.example.com,puppetmaster,...

- if only puppet master or it will be acting as the CA server run following to create CA
  certificates

	puppet master --verbose --no-daemonize

- for non-CA masters you have two options

	# run on CA server and manually copy certificate to new master (cert, key, public,
	# CA certificate and CRL)
	puppet cert generate <NAME> --dns_alt_names=<NAME1>,<NAME2>,... 

- or

	# request certificate on the master
	puppet agent --test --ca_server=<SERVER>

	# sign certificate on CA server
	puppet cert --allow-dns-alt-names sign <NAME>

	# retrieve cert on master
	puppet agent --test --ca_server=<SERVER>

keywords: master,server,directory,config,environments

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments.html

- environments are isolated groups of puppet agent nodes 

- master can serve each environment with completely different main manifests and modulepaths

- assign agent nodes to environments using either agent config file or an external node classifier

- $environment variable is available within manfiest files

- directory environments are created simply be adding a new directory of config data

- config environments are being deprecated in favor of directory environments

--- break

keywords: master,server,directory,environment

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/environments_configuring.html

- enable by setting following in master's puppet.conf ([main] or [master] section)

	environmentpath = $confdir/environments

- additional settings are

	basemodulepath : global modules that should be available in all environments
	default_manifest: default per-environment manifest or global manifest used by all

- must have a directory environment for every environment that any nodes are assigned to
  
- environment directory should contain modules and manifests directory

- each environment may contain an environment.conf file that can override several settings

- the following five settings in puppet.conf configure behaviour of directory environments

	environmentpath : list of directories where puppet will look for environments

	basemodulepath : list directories of global modules that all environments can access

	default_manifest : specifies main manifest for any environment that does set a manifest in
			   environment.conf (default value is ./manifests, i.e: environments own
			   manifest directory)

	disable_per_environment_manifest : lets you specify that all environments should use shared
					   manifest

	environment_timeout : sets how often puppet will refresh info about environments

keywords: master,server,passenger,rack

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/passenger.html

- passenger (AKA mod_rails / mod_rack) is apache module which lets you run Rails or Rack applications

- install necessary packages

	yum install httpd httpd-devel mod_ssl ruby-devel rubygems gcc
	
	gem install rack passenger

	passenger-install-apache2-module

- install puppet master Rack application by creating a directory for it and copying config.ru 
	
	mkdir -p /usr/share/puppet/rack/puppetmasterd

	mkdir /usr/share/puppet/rack/puppetmasterd/{public,tmp}

	cp /usr/share/puppet/ext/rack/config.ru /usr/share/puppet/rack/pupetmasterd

	chown puppet:puppet /usr/share/puppet/rack/puppetmasterd/config.ru

- config.ru tells Rack hwo to spawn puppet master processes

- create and enable puppet master virtual host

	cp /usr/share/puppet/ext/puppetmaster.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d

- edit vhost file accordingly

- agent node makes request to puppet master, mod_ssl performs verification of certificate and 
  passes this to puppet master via environment variables (HTTP_X_CLIENT_DN / subject DN  and 
  HTTP_X_CLIENT_VERIFY / verification status)

- option 1: statically designate servers on agent nodes

- option 2: use round-robin DNS

- option 3: use a load balancer

- option 4: DNS SRV records

--- break

keywords: master,server,multiple,load,balance,dns,srv

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scaling_multiple_masters.html#option-4-dns-srv-records

- new in 3.0 so all infrastructure must be on 3.0 or newer

- edit node puppet.conf and replace server with srv_domain

	[main]
	  use_srv_records = true
	  srv_domain = DOMAIN

- will lookup SRV record at _x-puppet._tcp.DOMAIN

- SRV record format, where priority and weight allow you to balance the traffic

	_service._proto.name. TTL class SRV priority weight port target

--- break

keywords: master,server,multiple,load,balance,certificate,authority,dns,srv

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scaling_multiple_masters.html#centralize-the-certificate-authority

- certificate authority functions should be delgated to a single server reachable at a unique
  hostname other than (or in addition to) puppet

- option 1 : direct agent nodes to CA master (configured via ca_server setting in puppet.conf)

- option 2: DNS SRV records at _x-puppet-ca._tcp.$srv_domain

--- break

keywords: master,server,multiple,load,balance,certificate,authority,proxy

link: https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scaling_multiple_masters.html#option-2-proxy-certificate-traffic

- if nodes don't have direct connectivity to CA you can config web server on masters to proxy all
  certificate-related traffic to designated CA master

- all certificate related URLs begin with /<NAME-OF-ENVIRONMENT>/certificate

- apache vhost configuration

	SSLProxyEngine On
	# proxy all requests
	ProxyPassMatch ^/([^/]+/certificate.*)$ https://puppetca.example.com:8140/$1

- if PassengerHighPerformance On you will need to disable it for the CA routes since it interferes
  with certain modules (mod_proxy being one of them)

	# disable for specific location
	<Location ~ "/[^/]+/certificate">
		PassengerHighPerformance off
	</Location>

- CA master must allow nodes to download CRL via proxy, without authentication (cert request and
  retrieval of signed certificates are allowed by default, but not CRLs), on master add following to
  auth.conf

	path /certificate_revocation_list
	auth any
	method find
	allow *
